# TASK 30 - FRONTEND-BACKEND INTEGRATION COMPLETION REPORT

## 🎯 TASK OBJECTIVE
Fix the remaining password confirmation validation issue in the registration form and achieve 100% frontend-backend integration success.

## ✅ FINAL STATUS: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

#### **1. Password Confirmation Validation Fix**
**Problem**: React Hook Form password confirmation validation was failing even with identical passwords.

**Root Cause**: The validation function was using a watched variable that wasn't properly synchronized with form state changes.

**Solution Applied**:
```javascript
// OLD (problematic):
validate: value => value === password || 'Le password non coincidono'

// NEW (fixed):
validate: (value, formValues) => {
  const currentPassword = formValues.password;
  console.log('Validating passwords - current:', currentPassword, 'confirm:', value);
  return value === currentPassword || 'Le password non coincidono';
}
```

**Additional Improvements**:
- Added `mode: 'onChange'` to useForm for real-time validation
- Removed unused variables to clean up the code
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting

#### **2. React Hook Form Configuration Enhancement**
```javascript
const {
  register,
  handleSubmit,
  formState: { errors },
} = useForm({
  mode: 'onChange', // Enable real-time validation
});
```
